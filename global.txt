Regional Settings (For Version 0.3.0)

These are the regional settings for version 0.3.0 of Life Simulator. As this game is still relatively new, all lives started are set in Sydney, Australia, the developer's place of residence. Hence there is only one region in the game. However, in the future, more regions may be added into the game, and hence this text document will document the settings used in the current version of the game.
