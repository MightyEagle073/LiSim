Version Number meaning
First number: 0 means the game is still in development and not complete, 1 means the game is out
Second number: Goes up by one everytime a major version is out (E.g. New features)
Third number: Goes up by one everytime a minor version is out (E.g. Bug fixes, information fixes, minor tweaks)
Fourth number: Is complicated, and you should not see a fourth number unless you are playing on a beta version (which I do not release)
	First digit: Odd means it is a beta for a new minor version, even means it is a beta for a new major version. Usually these should only be 1 or 2, but could be 3 or 4 if I started coding it near the end of the year. Shouldn't be anything else unless I take more than a year to code in that version!
	Second to fifth digits: The date when that version is completed, in the format of mmdd. Could be a day or two over if a lot of beta versions were released on a single day.
	Sixth digit: The nth beta version of the game released that day.
